# VILSOW: Code for Multi-view Multi-label Feature Selection By View-specific Implicit Label Information and Second-order Weight Matrix 

This repository contains the implementation of **VILSOW** and a demo using the `emotions` dataset.

## Requirements
* MATLAB (R2018a or later recommended)
* Dataset: `emotions.mat` (Included in `./datasets`)

## Quick Start
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the folder.
3. Run `demo_emotions.m`.

## Results
The script will output the evaluation metrics (Average Precision, Hamming Loss, etc.) in the command window and save the convergence plot to `./results`.
